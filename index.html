    <h2>My name is Aaron Essien, and I am currently a rising senior
    in Holy Trinity High School in Hicksville New York. I live in Baldwin, a small town in Long
    Island, which is a part of New York that many New Yorkers do not consider 'New York'. But the only 
    downfall of Long Island is that there aren't various forms of transportation such as those offered within
    the boroughs. Additonally, Long Island is more spread out, requiring you to get a car. Other than that,
     Long Island is not as bad as people put it out to be.
    </h2>
   <h2>I am currently in the process of looking at colleges, which is a overwhelming and stressful process, hpwever, after this
       summer I am certainly looking to major in computer science, sadly, which I know is going to give me anger issues in
       the near future.
